# Apollo Community Health Files

This repository acts as the foundation repository for GitHub configuration files that are **inherited (automatically) into all repositories in this organization**.

Read the [GitHub: Creating a Default Community Health File](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-default-community-health-file) for more information on how this works.

If you're coming here because you're adding a new public repository:

* ðŸš« **do not** add `SECURITY.md` or `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` files to the new repository because they are inherited from this central repository and we  otherwise lose having a single source of truth that we can update broadly.
* âœ… add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` explaining whether the project accpets contributions, what kind of contributions (Issues, Pull Requests, None) and how to best make them.
* âœ… add a `LICENSE.md`
