# Security Policy

At Apollo, we consider the security of our projects a top priority. No matter how much effort we put into system security, there can still be vulnerabilities present.

In the event that a vulnerability is discovered, we support **responsible disclosure** and we would like to know about it so we can take steps to address it, as quickly as possible, prior to public disclosure.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability, please do the following:

- E-mail your findings to `security` `[at]` `apollographql` `[dot]` `com`.
- **Do not** take advantage of the vulnerability or problem you have discovered, for example by downloading more data than necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability or deleting or modifying other people's data.
- **Do not** reveal the problem to others until it has been resolved.
- **Do not** use attacks on physical security, social engineering, distributed denial of service, spam or applications of third parties.
- **Do** provide sufficient information to reproduce the problem, so we will be able to resolve it as quickly as possible.  Complex vulnerabilities may require further explanation!

Our response:

- We will respond to your report **within 3 business days** with our evaluation of the report and an expected resolution date.
- If you have followed the instructions above, we will not take any legal action against you in regard to the report.
- We will handle your report with strict confidentiality, and not pass on your personal details to third parties without your permission.
- We will keep you informed of the progress towards resolving the problem.
- In the public information concerning the problem reported, we will give your name as the discoverer of the problem (unless you desire otherwise).
- We strive to resolve all problems as quickly as possible, and we would like to play an active role in the ultimate publication on the problem after it is resolved.
